## Outline

In today's class, we will...

- Review course logistics

\pause

- Guess how old the math faculty are

- Bring laptop to class on wednesday 9/2.

# How old are we?

## The Rules

- Photos for 9 math and stats faculty at Reed can be found on the schedule page of the course website, obtained from https://www.reed.edu/faculty-profiles/

- **Goal**: Estimate the age of each faculty member (at the time the picture was taken)

- Work in groups to develop a consistent method for estimating age. Think about:
  - What explicit features are you analyzing?
  - How do you convert these features to numeric estimates?
  - How do you resolve differences in opinion among group members?

- Record your estimates for each faculty member on a piece of paper and submit by the end of class

- **Note: not all pictures were taken in the current year**

## Debrief

- How should we quantify error?

- What are some sources for error in our estimates?

- How should we assess the overall accuracy of a group's predictions?

- Did any groups seem to consistently over- or under-estimate ages? By how much?

- Do any faculty member ages seem to consistently be over- or under-estimated?

- Are there any faculty members where the guesses seem to be in a particularly large or small range?

- We used this as a fun activity. But what are some potential problems and limitations of this type of investigation?
